# Council

Before an audit, address outstanding PR comments, fix known issues, and run relevant checks. Give council the updated implementation; do not defer known fixes until reviews return. If the user wants to discard the implementation and explore new ideas, skip fixes to code being replaced.

Bring in three delegates to help with the user's request, usually for review or feedback. Use one strong model from each of three different providers, at high reasoning effort. If the user's instructions name council members, use those. Otherwise pick the latest model from each provider, based on the Council Members list below.

In J5 Code, use `orchestrator_capabilities` to resolve the models, then `delegate_task` to start one delegate per model in parallel. Elsewhere, use the harness's subagent tools. If you cannot reach three providers, or a named member is unavailable, report it instead of substituting.

Give each delegate the request and relevant context. For review or feedback, keep their work read-only. Collect their responses and summarize the useful findings, disagreements, and recommended next steps.

Do not wait idle. When a result arrives, check its findings against the code at once and decide what to fix while the other delegates run. Do not edit files while a delegate still reviews the same checkout. If the user's instructions mark a delegate as non-blocking, do not wait for it; treat a late result as feedback and do not record its score.

If you were spawned by another agent to complete this task, pass the review findings and your decisions to it for its sign-off.  Wait until you have all the findings and decisions from the council before passing them.  That agent has more context on what the user wants and will provide judgement or ask the user for their final say.  Wait for their decision before making any changes.

For a code review, ask each delegate for a score out of 10. Count each full review pass as one round. A fresh review after fixes starts a new round.

If the work ends in a pull request, put the results in the PR description. Put this section before the model and harness line at the end:

```markdown
## Council review

Rounds: 2

| Delegate | Round 1 | Round 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Opus | 7/10 | 9/10 |
| GPT Sol | 8/10 | 10/10 |
| Grok | 7/10 | 9/10 |
```

If a delegate gives no score, write `no score`. Do not invent one. If the PR is open, edit the description. Do not post a comment for this. If there is no PR, put the same results in the final reply only.

If you agree with their recommendations, make the changes and request a fresh review after. Continue this process until all delegates are satisfied with the outcome.

Do not let repeated reviews result in scope creep. It is your job to fight to keep scope limited.

## Council Members
Include the latest version of Claude Opus and GPT Sol in each council.  If those are not available, stop and ask for help.  If Grok models are available, include one as well.
